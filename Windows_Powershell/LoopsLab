##Create a foreach loop that prompts the user for an ammount of test scores
##Then average the test scores
[int]$numOfGrades = read-host “How many grades would you like to enter?”
$numOfGradesArr = 1..$numOfGrades
foreach ($element in $numOfGradesArr) {
    [double]$sum += Read-Host “What are the scores?”
}
$average=$sum/$numOfGrades
Write-Host -Fore green “Your average score is $average”
Clear-Variable sum

##Do the same thing as above, using a while loop
[int]$numOfGrades = read-host "How many grades would you like to enter?"
while ($reportcard -lt $numOfGrades) {
    $reportcard++
    [int]$sum += Read-Host "What are the scores?"
}
$average = $sum/$numOfGrades
Write-Host -Fore green "Your average score is $average"
Clear-Variable sum
Clear-Variable reportcard
